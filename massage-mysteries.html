    <!-- Breathing Exercise -->
    <h2>Breathe in, breathe out</h2>
    <h3>Take a minute to...</h3>
    <ol>

    <!-- Tension -->
    <h2>It's a bit tense in here...</h2>
    <h3>Could it be you?</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Our world is go, go, go!</li>
      <li>When it's not go, go, go... it's do, do, do!</li>
      <li>But do we ever just stop, even for a moment?</li>
      <li>If your mind is always occupied, so is your body</li>
      <li>You might be surprised just how tense you are!</li>
      <li>Test yourself below</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Relax -->
    <h2>Just relax</h2>
    <h3>Go on, stop...</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Sit down as you would normally</li>
      <li>Look straight ahead, and one at a time:</li>
      <li>Relax your cheeks</li>
      <li>Open your mouth slightly and relax your jaw</li>
      <li>Keep breathing!</li>
      <li>Relax your shoulders, let them sink</li>
      <li>Drop and relax your arms/hands</li>
      <li>Relax your legs and feet</li>
      <li>Breathe in and out slowly for a minute</li>
      <li>After breaths, scan your body for tension and relax again</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>How did you go?</h2>
    <h3>Your body will thank you</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Do this three or more times a day</li>
      <li>Fifty years ago we had time to think, time to sink</li>
      <li>These days we're always wired - alert, watching, listening</li>
      <li>Turn off the TV</li>
      <li>Mute the music</li>
      <li>Just... be...</li>
    </ul>

<!-- Traffic lights teach our cars to go, stop, and slow down. Can you imagine if there were no amber? And cars were expected just to go and stop? Why do we take out the amber when dealing with ourselves? We go, go, go, and then expect that we can just lie in bed and stop. We were made to slow down too -->

<!-- After massage, do something, show that brain how you should be moving -->
